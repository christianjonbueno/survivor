# Survivor (Outwit, Outplay, Outlast)

Made an app where my friends and I keep track of the stats of the current season of Survivor. It is currently a work in progress as I am updating it as the season progresses. 

Some functionalities include:
- Choose which season. (Pick between seasons. Only one season at the moment)
- User to User trades. (Users can trade players any time)
- Stat editing. (Edit the current stats of players)

Tech used:
- MongoDB w/ Mongoose
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Axios
- Bootstrap

Things to add:
- Search functionality to search for any player to bring up their stats
- User login. Have admin access vs user access.
